# Police brutality data aggregation

The Project consists of building a dataset by combining 3 different kinds of data sources. A CSV file that contains policy data for 100 major police departments. Web Scraping was utilized to collect Organization IDâ€™s and names of departments to use for the API. An FBI API was used combined with the prior Data to collect specific counts of various crimes. The information was joined between the scraped and API data, unfortunately the CSV file did not contain enough specific Organization Identification to join the last dataset.
